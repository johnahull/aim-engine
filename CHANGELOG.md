## [Unreleased]

<!-- Populate this section during release-prep, then rename to the release version -->

### Added
- **NVIDIA GPU serving end to end.** `AIMProfile`/`AIMClusterProfile` gain `spec.acceleratorVendor` (`amd` | `nvidia`), which resolves both the node-affinity term (`feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.vendor.GPU.<VENDOR>`) and the device-plugin resource (`amd.com/gpu` vs `nvidia.com/gpu`). A generic NVIDIA profile can omit `acceleratorModel` and match any NVIDIA GPU node. Empty vendor keeps the previous AMD behaviour, so existing profiles are unaffected. The accelerator detector's vendor labels, previously published for discovery only, are now consumed by the operator. `acceleratorVendor` is also available on profile selectors and on `AIMService.spec.profile.overrides`.
- **Direct upstream vLLM runtime contract.** A profile with `acceleratorVendor: nvidia` and `engine: vllm` is projected as a `vllm serve` invocation against the mounted artifact — AIM Engine generates the model path, `--served-model-name`, `--host`, `--port` and `--tensor-parallel-size`, promotes `engineEnv` to container env, and forces Hugging Face offline mode. `engineArgs` becomes optional tuning. These runtimes expose vLLM's native OpenAI API and do not declare KServe protocol v2. AMD AIM images keep their baked entrypoint and the existing AIM-runtime env contract.
- **Generated-profile model onboarding (`spec.modelId`).** A v1alpha2 `AIMModel`/`AIMClusterModel` can be onboarded by model identity instead of by image; profiles are generated from `AIMRuntimeConfig` `spec.model.profileGeneration.fallbacks` matched against observed cluster hardware. `aimId` defaults to `modelId` and weights default to `hf://<modelId>`, both overridable (`spec.aimId`, `spec.source`). `spec.accelerator` requests the hardware shape (`count`, `vendor`, `model`, `partitioningMode`); `count` drives both the device request and tensor-parallel size and defaults to 1. Reported as `status.kind: Generated` with `status.profileGeneration.strategy` (`RuntimeFallback` today) so a future AMD catalog lookup can be added without reclassifying existing models. Profiles carry `profile-origin: generated`. **This flow does not yet perform an AMD catalog lookup** — AMD catalog onboarding remains the image-backed Official flow.
- **Out-of-the-box NVIDIA model-ID runtime policy.** Helm now installs a chart-managed `AIMClusterRuntimeConfig/default` containing a generic NVIDIA vLLM fallback. The fallback omits generic CPU/memory requests, remains truthfully `unoptimized`, and uses `autoSelectionPolicy: any` so it is selected only when no optimized profile matches and the service did not explicitly set `minimumType`. It can be overridden or disabled when a platform manages its own runtime policy.
- **Static model declarations on `AIMClusterModelSource`** via `spec.models[]` (`modelId`, optional `aimId`, `source`, `accelerator`), which can be combined with `filters` or `images`. Declared models materialize as v1alpha2 `AIMClusterModel` resources — v1alpha1 CEL rejects `spec.modelId`, so only this path uses the v1alpha2 client; registry discovery continues to write v1alpha1 unchanged. Unlike discovered images, models a source owns are kept in sync with their declaration; neither kind is ever deleted.
- `make install-nvidia-dependencies` installs the NVIDIA Kubernetes device plugin and its bundled NFD (`hack/nvidia/`). Host driver, container toolkit and `nvidia` RuntimeClass must already exist.
- **`s3://` artifact downloads rewritten on boto3**, replacing the `s3cmd` shell path. Credentials now resolve through the standard boto3 chain when `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are unset, so IRSA, EKS Pod Identity, ECS task roles, EC2 instance profiles, shared profiles and credential processes work for the first time. Note that download Jobs run under the namespace's `default` ServiceAccount, so IRSA and Pod Identity require annotating it. New `AIM_S3_*` env knobs tune addressing style, signature version, region and multipart concurrency. (#158)
- **Anonymous (unsigned) S3 access** for public buckets, requested explicitly with `AIM_S3_ANONYMOUS=true` or by setting a credential variable to `anonymous`. Omitting the credentials instead means "resolve them from the environment" — it is not read as a public bucket, because every role-based credential source deliberately leaves those variables unset. Partial credentials, and a real key combined with an `anonymous` sentinel, are now rejected with a specific error instead of silently falling back to unsigned requests. (#158)

### Changed
- **CRDs must now be installed with `kubectl apply --server-side`.** The v1alpha2 schemas exceed the 262144-byte annotation limit that client-side apply relies on. `make install`, the README and the installation guide are updated. Existing client-side-applied installs are migrated automatically by kubectl; if CRDs are also managed by the Helm CRD chart, verify there is no field-manager conflict before upgrading.
- `AIMClusterModelSource` now watches v1alpha2 `AIMClusterModel`. v1alpha2 is the storage version, so this observes the same objects as before.
- **`AIMArtifact` events now reach every `AIMTemplateCache` referencing the artifact**, not just the cache that created it. Caches are indexed by `status.artifacts[].name`; the creator-label path is retained for newly created artifacts and legacy caches. Shared artifacts previously left non-creator caches stuck until their next resync.
- **`s3://` downloads against a custom `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` now sign with Signature V4 by default**, where the previous `s3cmd`-based downloader forced Signature V2. Backends that only accept V2 need `AIM_S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION=s3`. (#158)

### Fixed
- `AIM_S3_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` now increases only downloader-package verbosity; botocore, boto3, s3transfer, urllib3, and the process root remain at `WARNING`, preventing SDK wire logs from emitting signed headers or temporary credential responses.
- S3 object transfers now verify every downloaded object's listed size before atomic publication, so truncated or partial transfers are never published.
- Typed S3 connections now separate administrator RuntimeConfig environment from artifact-level environment. RuntimeConfig can still select infrastructure proxies and credential providers, while `AIMArtifact.spec.env` is limited to validated downloader tuning; proxy, process, trust, and credential-source overrides are rejected with `ConfigValid=False`.
- Generated-model `NoCompatibleRuntime` conditions and warning events now explain why each configured fallback was rejected, including missing accelerator labels, model/request mismatches, and insufficient per-node resources such as `nvidia.com/gpu requested 1, allocatable 0`. Diagnostics are bounded for large clusters instead of collapsing every mismatch into the generic "no runtime matches" message.
- S3 authentication failures are now classified as auth errors rather than an invalid spec. `AccessDenied` and botocore's "Unable to locate credentials" matched none of the existing patterns, so a credentials problem surfaced as `ConfigValid=False`/`InvalidSpec` and pointed at the artifact's `sourceUri`. Missing buckets and empty prefixes still classify as source problems. (#158)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **v1alpha2 API (`aim.eai.amd.com/v1alpha2`)** — new `AIMModel`/`AIMClusterModel`, `AIMProfile`/`AIMClusterProfile`, `AIMProfileSet`/`AIMClusterProfileSet`, and `AIMProfileCache` resources, introducing a profile-based deployment path alongside the existing template path. `AIMService` can resolve a profile by `name` or by `selector`. (#111, #122)
- **LoRA adapter serving** — `AIMArtifact` gains `spec.type: model|adapter` and a shared ReadWriteMany adapter disk (`spec.adapterDisk`) on the base-model artifact; `AIMService.spec.adapters` plus `spec.adapterMode` (`static`/`dynamic`) serve adapters, with dynamic mode hot-loading/unloading without restarting the pod. (#130)
- **Scale-to-zero** — set `AIMService.spec.minReplicas: 0` to idle a service to zero replicas and reactivate on the next request via KEDA. Adds `spec.autoScaling.pollingInterval` and `spec.autoScaling.cooldownPeriod`, a memory-derived cooldown heuristic, and a chart-managed gateway-metrics OpenTelemetry collector. Requires routing to be enabled. (#117)
- **GPU partitioning (ADR-009a/009b)** — profiles can target GPU partition slices via `acceleratorPartitioningMode`; the accelerator detector now publishes current partition state as NFD labels. (#120)
- Server-side field-selector filtering of profiles by model architecture: `spec.aimId` is a selectable field on `AIMProfile`/`AIMClusterProfile` (e.g. `kubectl get aimprofile --field-selector spec.aimId=qwen/qwen3-32b`). (#133)
- Expanded `AIMService.spec.profileOverrides` (v1alpha2): override `modelSources`, `acceleratorModel`, `acceleratorCount`, `acceleratorPartitioningMode`, and `engineEnv`, and merge `containerEnv`/`engineArgs` onto a referenced profile without forking it.
- Helm: `manager.artifactDownloaderImage` install-time override, an optional `clusterModelSource` block for cluster-wide model discovery, and a `scaleFromZero` tuning block.

### Changed
- **Minimum supported Kubernetes version raised to 1.32**, required for the `CustomResourceFieldSelectors` feature (GA in 1.32) that backs the new profile selectable field.
- Serving containers now derive their `ImagePullPolicy` from the image tag (`Always` for `:latest`/tagless, `IfNotPresent` for versioned/digest tags) instead of always pulling, matching kubelet defaults and allowing pre-loaded (e.g. `kind load`) images to be used.
- Template selection now uses a minimum-type floor instead of manual selection. (#139)
- Autoscaling specs are validated more strictly: an empty `autoScaling` block and under-specified metric/target entries are now rejected by CEL.
- `acceleratorCount` now matches guaranteed CPU QoS for EPYC CPU profiles. (#134)

### Deprecated
- v1alpha1 `AIMModel` and `AIMClusterModel` are deprecated in favor of their v1alpha2 equivalents. They still function (with a deprecation warning) but are scheduled for removal — the v1alpha1 reconciliation logic will be deleted in a future release and these resources will no longer be served. Plan your migration to v1alpha2 now. (#111)

### Fixed
- Inference route auth bypass on multi-listener gateways (EAI-6951): generated HTTPRoutes are now pinned to the configured `spec.routing.hostnames`, and a routing-enabled service on a Gateway with more than one listener now requires a hostname — without one no route is created and the service reports `ConfigValid=False`/`RouteHostnameRequired`. Single-listener gateways are unaffected. (#142)
- Empty `AIMService` profile name is now treated as omitted rather than a validation error. (#151)
- Eliminated AIMClusterModelSource/AIMModel reconcile error loops. (#131)
- Prevented AIMClusterModelSource from hammering the registry. (#123)
- Fixed v1alpha2 cache download token handling. (#140)
- Keep the optimized image when profile derivation leaves weights unchanged. (#136)
- Allow zero-byte files in download verification. (#105)
- Delete stale `*.lock` files on cleanup. (#135)
- Artifact downloader: install `click` so the HuggingFace CLI runs (#127), and emit a warning if the disk-usage call hangs in the stall detector (#154).
- v1alpha2 AIMService endpoint allows updating an existing v1alpha1 object. (#122)
- Removed the API version from the controller name. (#153)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- `aimId`-based template matching for fine-tuned models — specify `spec.aimId` and `spec.modelSources` on an AIMModel and the controller automatically finds matching official templates, filters by version policy, and creates copies with custom weight sources baked in. No `customTemplates` or `custom.hardware` required.
- `spec.aimId` field on AIMModelSpec for identifying the base model family when onboarding fine-tuned weights.
- `spec.custom.versionPolicy` field on AIMCustomModelSpec (`pinned`, `latest`, `any`) for controlling which template versions are matched.
- `status.version` field on AIMServiceTemplateStatus, populated from the owning model's image tag during reconciliation.
- E2E tests for fine-tuned model flows: pinned version matching, no-match negative case, and cluster-to-namespace cross-scope matching (`tests/e2e/aimmodel/fine-tuned/`).
- Support for AMD Radeon Pro W7900 and Radeon AI Pro R9700 as first-class GPU targets in AIMModel and AIMServiceTemplate, including device-ID node affinity and GPU-preference ranking (ranked below all Instinct models).
- Discovery jobs now also emit `AIM_ACCELERATOR_MODEL` / `AIM_ACCELERATOR_COUNT` alongside the legacy `AIM_GPU_*` variables, and accept `accelerator_*` fields in profile metadata, so v1alpha1 works against AIM images that use the newer accelerator-oriented schema.

### Changed
- Controller image and Helm/CRDs OCI charts now publish to `docker.io/amdenterpriseai/*` instead of `ghcr.io/silogen/*`; the chart's `manager.image.repository` defaults to `docker.io/amdenterpriseai/aim-engine` (#114).
- `manager.imagePullSecrets` default renamed from `regcred` to `dockerhub-regcred`;

### Fixed
- Tilt dev deployment uses `Recreate` strategy to prevent pod restart deadlocks caused by RWO PVC contention during rolling updates.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Artifact storage quota enforcement with configurable cluster-wide and per-namespace limits via `artifactStorageQuota` in RuntimeConfig (#60)
- Automatic artifact eviction when storage quota is exceeded, with priority-based ordering via `retentionPriority` and `defaultRetentionPriority` (#60)
- Eviction protection annotation (`aim.eai.amd.com/eviction-protected`) to exempt specific artifacts from automatic eviction (#60)
- Download filter support (`downloadFilter`) on AIMArtifact and RuntimeConfig to control which files are included/excluded during HuggingFace downloads — subdirectory files are now excluded by default (#56)
- Custom profile support for AIMServiceTemplate and AIMModel custom templates — define inline engine args and env vars without needing a pre-built AIM image (#61)
- `priorityClassName` field on AIMService to set Kubernetes PriorityClass on inference pods (#50)
- AIMService annotations are now included in generated HTTPRoutes, with service annotations taking precedence over runtime config annotations (#55)
- Template health checks surfaced in AIMService status with selection reason and message (#31)

### Changed
- Artifact downloader image version is now set at build time via ldflags to match the release tag, replacing the hardcoded default (#15)
- Runtime status replica fields (`currentReplicas`, `desiredReplicas`, `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`) are now always reported, including zero values on startup (#58)
- AIMService status remains `Running` while scaling when ready pods still exist, using new `RuntimeScaling` reason (#59)
- Cache status messages now propagate root cause from template cache conditions instead of generic strings (#53)
- CI workflows updated: artifact downloader builds on tags with configurable version input, publish-main workflow for package repository (#15, #57)

### Fixed
- Environment variable expansion and kustomize build overwrite bug resolved (#49)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

Initial public release of AIM Engine — a Kubernetes operator for deploying AI inference workloads on AMD Instinct GPUs.

## Highlights

- **Declarative inference deployment** — Deploy production-ready endpoints with a single `AIMService` resource. The operator handles model resolution, template selection, KServe InferenceService creation, and HTTP routing.
- **Built for optimized AIM images** — Pre-built containers packaging open-source models tuned for AMD Instinct GPUs with optimized serving runtimes.
- **Automatic model catalog** — Discover AIM images from container registries with wildcard filters, version constraints, and periodic sync.
- **Smart template selection** — Multi-stage algorithm selects the optimal runtime profile based on GPU availability, precision, and optimization metric.
- **Model caching** — Pre-download model weights to shared PVCs. Shared and Dedicated modes control lifecycle and reuse.
- **Multi-protocol downloads** — HuggingFace downloads with configurable protocol fallback (XET, HF_TRANSFER, HTTP).
- **Gateway API routing** — HTTPRoute creation with customizable path templates.
- **KEDA autoscaling** — Scale on OpenTelemetry metrics from the vLLM runtime.
- **Multi-tenancy** — Namespace and cluster-scoped resource variants with resolution order and label propagation.

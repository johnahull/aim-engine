// FindReadyShared returns a Ready, profile-owned (Shared) AIMProfileCache in
// namespace that caches the profile named profileName at the given scope, or nil
// when none exists.
//
// This is the single cache-resolution used by BOTH runtime-projection paths: the
// eager profile reconciler (which mounts the cache on the per-profile / model-slug
// ServingRuntime it projects) and the lazy InferenceService-watch reconciler
// (which mounts it on the namespace shadow it materializes). Keeping them on one
// helper is what makes serving correctness mode-independent — an eager complete
// namespace runtime and a lazy shadow resolve and mount the identical cache.
//
// Resolution is deliberately decoupled from the profile's spec.caching.enabled
// flag and from the cache's object name. Both a profile-owned cache (created when
// the profile opts into caching, named after the profile) and a service-driven
// Shared cache (created by an AIMService in Shared mode, named
// <profile>-cache-<hash>) qualify, because both carry spec.profileName +
// spec.mode=Shared referencing the same profile. Only a Ready Shared cache whose
// profileName and scope match is returned; a service-owned (Dedicated) cache is
// overlaid on its own consuming ISVC instead, never mounted on the shared runtime.
//
// Scope comparison mirrors the AIMService resolver's convention: an empty scope
// (on either the query or a cache's spec) is normalized to Namespace, so a cache
// written without an explicit scope still resolves for a namespace-scoped query.

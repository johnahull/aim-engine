# adapter-reap.sh reclaims per-service adapter subtrees on a shared adapter disk
# whose owning AIMService is no longer live, plus crash-orphaned .staging/.aside
# entries and atomically-unloaded bytes under .unload-tmp. Adapter subtrees are
# not Kubernetes objects, so owner-ref GC cannot reclaim them; the aim-engine
# controller periodically launches this reaper Job (the sole RW writer alongside
# staging and subtree-sync Jobs).
#
# Contract (env):
#   ADAPTER_PVC_ROOT  Mount path of the adapter-disk PVC (mounted RW at its root).
#   KEEP_SERVICE_IDS  Comma-separated list of live AIMService subtree IDs to keep.
#   MIN_AGE_SECONDS   Grace period: never reap a subtree modified more recently
#                     than this (defaults to 0 = disabled when unset/invalid).
#
# Safety: the keep-list is a snapshot taken by the controller at reconcile time
# and may be stale by the time this Job's pod actually runs, so a subtree created
# in that gap could be absent from KEEP. The MIN_AGE_SECONDS grace guard is the
# real safety net: it refuses to delete recently-touched subtrees regardless of
# keep-list freshness, so a stale/empty list leaves garbage (reclaimed next pass)
# instead of deleting a live, mounted subtree.

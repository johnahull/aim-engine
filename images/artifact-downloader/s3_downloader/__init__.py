"""S3-compatible object-storage downloader for AIM artifacts.

Uses boto3-backed cloudpathlib so a single configuration works across S3-v4
backends. Validated end-to-end against MinIO (SeaweedFS is exercised as the
built-in artifact cache backend); AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, GCS and
Ceph RGW use the same boto3 path and are expected to work. Configured entirely
via the AWS_*/AIM_S3_* environment variables passed to the download Job.

"""Environment-driven construction of a cloudpathlib S3Client.

Defaults fall back to boto3 behaviour (Signature V4, auto path-vs-virtual
addressing, and the standard credential chain). Validated end-to-end against
MinIO; AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, GCS and Ceph RGW use the same boto3
path and are expected to work. Optional AIM_S3_* knobs override region,
addressing style, signature version and multipart tuning when a backend needs
it.

Credentials resolve in one of three modes; see _credential_mode. The important
rule is that absent credentials are handed to boto3 rather than treated as a
public bucket, so IRSA and the other role-based sources keep working. Anonymous
access is opt-in via AIM_S3_ANONYMOUS or an "anonymous" sentinel key.

# adapter-stage.sh stages a single LoRA adapter into a per-AIMService subtree of a
# shared adapter-disk PVC, then atomically promotes it into the live tree via
# rename(2). The aim-engine controller orchestrates this Job; the Job is the sole
# logical writer to the live tree (the controller never mounts the PVC).
#
# Contract (env):
#   ADAPTER_PVC_ROOT  Mount path of the adapter-disk PVC (mounted RW at its root).
#   SERVICE_ID        Per-service subtree directory name (encodes the AIMService UID).
#   ADAPTER_PATH      On-disk directory name for this adapter.
#   JOB_ID            Unique suffix for the staging directory (collision/crash safe).
#   $1                Source URI (hf:// or s3://).
#
# Staging/aside areas live at the PVC ROOT (outside the pod subPath mount) so
# consumers never observe in-progress bytes, while staying on the same filesystem
# so rename stays atomic.

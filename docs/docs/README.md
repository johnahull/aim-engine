# AIM Engine

AIM (AMD Inference Microservice) Engine is a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of AI inference workloads on AMD GPUs. It provides a declarative, cloud-native approach to running ML models at scale.

## Quick example

Deploy an inference service in two resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: aim.eai.amd.com/v1alpha2
kind: AIMClusterModel
metadata:
  name: qwen3-32b
spec:
  image: amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b:0.8.5
---
apiVersion: aim.eai.amd.com/v1alpha2
kind: AIMService
metadata:
  name: qwen-chat
  namespace: ml-team
  annotations:
    aim.eai.amd.com/reconciler-pipeline: profile
spec:
  model:
    name: qwen3-32b
```

AIM images (like `amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b`) package open-source models optimized for AMD Instinct GPUs. Each image includes the model weights and a serving runtime tuned for specific GPU configurations and precision modes.

The `AIMModel` runs discovery on the image and publishes one `AIMProfile` per supported (GPU, precision, metric) combination. The `AIMService` resolves to the best deployable profile for your hardware, pre-warms the model cache, and creates a KServe `InferenceService`.

:::{admonition} Why the `reconciler-pipeline: profile` annotation?
:class: note

AIMService dispatch is decided by **spec shape**, not by `apiVersion`. During the v1alpha1 → v1alpha2 migration window, `spec.model.name` and `spec.model.image` default to the legacy template pipeline so existing deployments keep working unchanged. The annotation forces this service onto the v1alpha2 profile pipeline, which resolves `qwen3-32b` to one of the `AIMClusterProfile`s produced by the `AIMClusterModel` above. The annotation becomes unnecessary once v1alpha1 is removed — see [Migration window](admin/upgrading.md#migration-window) for the full dispatch table.

## Three model flows

How you onboard a model depends on its relationship to AMD's published catalog:

| Flow | Use when | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| **Official** | Deploying a published AMD-supported AIM model unmodified | [AIM Models](concepts/models.md#flow-1-official-aim-model) |
| **Fine-tuned** | Deploying a fine-tune of a published architecture | [Fine-Tuned Models](guides/fine-tuned-models.md) |
| **Custom** | Deploying a model whose architecture isn't in the catalog | [Custom Models](guides/custom-models.md) |

## Key features

- **Three-flow model onboarding** — official AIM images, fine-tuned models, and custom models that bring their own weights, all expressed through a single `AIMModel` shape.
- **Profile-driven deployment** — `AIMService` resolves to a self-contained `AIMProfile` with everything the runtime needs (image, accelerator, engine config, model sources).
- **Smart selection** — pick a profile by name, by model, by selector, or by model+selector; the controller ranks candidates by `primary > type > version`.
- **Profile overlays** — `spec.profileOverrides` rebases a published profile onto custom weights without forking it.
- **Model caching** — pre-download artifacts to shared PVCs for faster startup; HuggingFace downloader falls back across XET / HF_TRANSFER / HTTP protocols.
- **HTTP routing** — expose services through Gateway API with customizable path templates.
- **Autoscaling** — KEDA integration with OpenTelemetry metrics for demand-based scaling.
- **Multi-tenancy** — namespace-scoped and cluster-scoped resources for flexible team isolation.

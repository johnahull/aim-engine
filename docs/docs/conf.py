"""Sphinx configuration for the AIM Engine documentation.

Built with rocm-docs-core (AMD's official docs theme: pydata-sphinx-theme +
sphinx-book-theme + MyST + sphinx-design + sphinx-external-toc), so the local
preview matches the published umbrella site at
https://enterprise-ai.docs.amd.com.

This project also builds standalone and is aggregated into the umbrella
AMDEnterpriseAISuiteDocs site, where the contents of ``docs/docs`` are rsynced
under ``docs/aim-engine/`` (see
``.github/workflows/copy-docs-to-public-docs.yaml``) and built by that repo's
own config. To keep both modes working: all internal links are relative ``.md``
links, the table of contents lives in ``_toc.yml``, and nothing hardcodes the
``aim-engine/`` prefix that only exists in the umbrella site.

# Quickstart

Deploy your first inference service in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- AIM Engine [installed](installation.md) on your cluster
- AMD GPUs available in the cluster (or a CPU-only profile for testing)
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster

## Step 1: Apply a model

Apply an AMD-published AIM model. This is the [official flow](../concepts/models.md#flow-1-official-aim-model) — `spec.image` points at the AIM container image and discovery materialises deployable profiles.

```yaml
apiVersion: aim.eai.amd.com/v1alpha2
kind: AIMClusterModel
metadata:
  name: qwen3-32b
spec:
  image: amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b:0.8.5
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f model.yaml
```

If you set up [model discovery](../concepts/model-sources.md) during installation, official models are already in the catalog:

```bash
kubectl get aimclustermodels
```

Wait for discovery to complete and at least one deployable profile to land:

```bash
kubectl get aimclustermodel qwen3-32b -o jsonpath='{.status.managedProfiles}'
# {"deployable":5,"notAvailable":0,"ready":5,"base":0,"total":5}
```

## Step 2: Deploy an AIMService

Reference the model and let the controller pick the best deployable profile for your hardware.

```yaml
apiVersion: aim.eai.amd.com/v1alpha2
kind: AIMService
metadata:
  name: qwen-chat
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    aim.eai.amd.com/reconciler-pipeline: profile
spec:
  model:
    name: qwen3-32b
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

AIM Engine then:

1. Resolves the model to the highest-ranked deployable `AIMProfile` for the available hardware.
2. Pre-warms the cache by creating an `AIMProfileCache` and downloading model artifacts to a PVC.
3. Creates a KServe `InferenceService` mounting the cache and the profile's container image.
4. Optionally creates an `HTTPRoute` if routing is enabled.

The `reconciler-pipeline: profile` annotation is required for model-shaped
services during the v1alpha1 → v1alpha2 migration window. See
[Spec-shape dispatch](../admin/upgrading.md#spec-shape-dispatch).

## Step 3: Monitor progress

```bash
kubectl get aimservice qwen-chat -w
```

The status progresses through `Pending` → `Starting` → `Running`. The service pauses in `Starting` while the cache fills (this can take several minutes for large models).

For detail:

```bash
kubectl get aimservice qwen-chat -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq
```

The key conditions to watch:

- `ProfileReady` → `ProfileResolved`
- `ProfileCacheReady` → `CacheReady`
- `InferenceServiceReady` → `RuntimeReady`
- `Ready` → `AllComponentsReady`

## Step 4: Send a request

The InferenceService name is derived from the service — look it up by label:

```bash
kubectl get inferenceservice -n default -l aim.eai.amd.com/service.name=qwen-chat
```

Port-forward the predictor service:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n default svc/<isvc-name>-predictor 8080:80
```

Discover the model ID registered by the serving runtime:

```bash
MODEL_ID=$(curl --fail --silent --show-error http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq -er '.data[0].id')
echo "${MODEL_ID}"
# Qwen/Qwen3-32B
```

Use the returned `id` as the `model` value in inference requests. The served
model ID is typically the model's canonical Hugging Face name, not the
`AIMService` resource name, and varies with the deployed AIM image.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"model\": \"${MODEL_ID}\",
    \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}]
  }"
```

## Variations

### Pick a specific profile

Bypass automatic selection by referencing a profile directly:

```yaml
spec:
  profile:
    name: qwen-qwen3-32b-mi300x-fp8-latency
```

### Narrow by precision or accelerator

```yaml
spec:
  model:
    name: qwen3-32b
  profile:
    selector:
      precision: fp8
      acceleratorModel: MI300X
      metric: latency
```

### Dedicated cache

The default `Shared` caching mode reuses the PVC across services. Use `Dedicated` for per-service isolation:

```yaml
spec:
  model:
    name: qwen3-32b
  caching:
    mode: Dedicated
```

See [Model Caching](../guides/model-caching.md) for the full lifecycle.

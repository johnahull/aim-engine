# Architecture

AIM Engine is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates the full lifecycle of AI inference workloads on AMD GPUs. It bridges the gap between model artifacts and production-ready inference endpoints by coordinating several Kubernetes-native components.

## High-level architecture

AIM Engine has two cooperating flows that meet at the `AIMProfile`: **onboarding** turns models into deployable profiles, and **serving** turns a profile into a running endpoint. Throughout these diagrams, colour denotes the kind of resource — blue for user-applied, red for operator controllers, green for operator-managed, grey for infrastructure.

### Onboarding: from models to profiles

Official models (via discovery), profile sets (via derivation), and hand-authored profiles all converge on a deployable `AIMProfile`.

### Serving: from profile to endpoint

An `AIMService` resolves one of those profiles, and the Service controller creates the cache, InferenceService, and route that back a running endpoint.

## CRDs and their roles

v1alpha2 is the current API. v1alpha1 resources remain supported during the deprecation window — see [Legacy v1alpha1](../legacy/index.md).

| CRD | Scope | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `AIMService` | Namespace | Deploys an inference endpoint by resolving a profile and creating a KServe InferenceService. |
| `AIMModel` / `AIMClusterModel` | Namespace / Cluster | Onboards a model — four flows (official, generated, fine-tuned, custom). Produces profiles. |
| `AIMProfile` / `AIMClusterProfile` | Namespace / Cluster | Self-contained runtime configuration (image, accelerator, engine args, model sources). The unit a service resolves to. |
| `AIMProfileSet` / `AIMClusterProfileSet` | Namespace / Cluster | Derives profiles by selector + overrides. Usually synthesised by `AIMModel.spec.profiles`, also usable standalone. |
| `AIMProfileCache` | Namespace | Pre-warms a profile's `modelSources` to a PVC for fast service start. |
| `AIMArtifact` | Namespace | Manages a single model artifact download to a PVC. |
| `AIMClusterModelSource` | Cluster | Auto-discovers AIM images from a registry (`spec.filters`/`spec.images`) or materializes declared model IDs (`spec.models`). Declared models are created as v1alpha2 `AIMClusterModel`, since `spec.modelId` is a v1alpha2-only field; discovered images are created as v1alpha1. Both are the same stored object — v1alpha2 is the storage version. |
| `AIMRuntimeConfig` / `AIMClusterRuntimeConfig` | Namespace / Cluster | Storage defaults, routing defaults, environment defaults. |

## Four model flows

Every `AIMModel` resolves to one of four flows, selected by which spec field is set. The full mechanics live in [AIM Models](../concepts/models.md):

| Flow | Spec | Source of profiles |
|---|---|---|
| **Official** | `spec.image` (AIM image) | Image discovery — profile YAMLs inside the container |
| **Generated** | `spec.modelId` | Hardware-matched RuntimeConfig fallbacks |
| **Fine-tuned** | `spec.profiles.derivedFrom` (selecting deployable profiles) | A previously-applied official AIMModel |
| **Custom** | `spec.profiles.derivedFrom` (selecting base-image base profiles) | A previously-applied base-image AIMModel |

CRD validation enforces exactly one of `spec.image`, `spec.modelId`, or
`spec.profiles`.

## Service resolution

When you apply an `AIMService`, the controller reaches a single `AIMProfile` through one of five resolution shapes:

  <img alt="AIMService resolution shapes converging on a single resolved AIMProfile, then an optional overlay before deployment." src="../assets/diagrams/service-resolution.svg">
</picture>

The image shape requires the `aim.eai.amd.com/reconciler-pipeline: profile` annotation during the migration window — see [Migration window](../admin/upgrading.md#migration-window). See [Services](../concepts/services.md#resolution-shapes) for the canonical resolution table and mechanics.

## Cluster vs namespace scope

Several CRDs have both a namespace-scoped and a cluster-scoped variant.

| Namespace | Cluster | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AIMModel` | `AIMClusterModel` | Model definitions |
| `AIMProfile` | `AIMClusterProfile` | Runtime configurations |
| `AIMProfileSet` | `AIMClusterProfileSet` | Profile derivation |
| `AIMRuntimeConfig` | `AIMClusterRuntimeConfig` | Storage, routing, environment defaults |

**Cluster-scoped** resources are shared across all namespaces. Platform admins create them to provide a model catalog and validated runtime profiles.

**Namespace-scoped** resources are visible only within their namespace. Teams create them for custom models or per-project overrides.

### Resolution order

When an AIMService needs a model or profile, AIM Engine resolves it in this order:

1. **Namespace** — look for the resource in the service's namespace.
2. **Cluster** — fall back to the cluster-scoped variant.

Namespace wins. The resolved scope is recorded in `status.resolvedModel.scope` and `status.resolvedProfile.scope`.

**RuntimeConfig** is special: if both namespace and cluster configs exist, they're **merged** rather than one replacing the other. Namespace values override cluster values for any fields set in both.

## Reconciliation pipeline

Every AIM controller follows the same pipeline:

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../assets/diagrams/reconcile-pipeline-dark.svg">
  <img alt="The shared reconciliation pipeline: Fetch, Compose, Plan, Apply, Status." src="../assets/diagrams/reconcile-pipeline.svg">
</picture>

Each step is idempotent: the operator converges toward the desired state on every reconciliation, handling partial failures and eventual consistency gracefully.

## Integration points

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **KServe** | Underlying model serving runtime. AIM Engine creates and manages `InferenceService` resources. |
| **Gateway API** | HTTP routing. When routing is enabled, AIM Engine creates `HTTPRoute` resources attached to a configured Gateway. |
| **Persistent Volumes** | Back the caching system. `AIMProfileCache` downloads model artifacts once to shared (or dedicated) PVCs. |
| **AMD GPUs + NFD** | Detected via node labels (`feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.<model>`) written by the AcceleratorDetector DaemonSet. The profile selector filters candidates by node label availability. |

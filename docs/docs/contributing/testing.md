# Testing

AIM Engine uses Go unit tests and [Chainsaw](https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/) for declarative e2e tests.

## Unit Tests

```bash
make test                           # All unit tests (excludes e2e)
go test ./internal/v1alpha1/aimservice -v    # Specific package
go test ./internal/... -run TestFoo # Specific test
```

## E2E Tests (Chainsaw)

Chainsaw tests are declarative YAML files in `tests/e2e/`. Each test directory contains a `chainsaw-test.yaml` that defines steps: apply resources, assert conditions, run scripts.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Ensure the operator is running and ready
make wait-ready

# Run all tests for the current environment
make test-chainsaw

# Run a specific test directory
make test-chainsaw CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR=tests/e2e/aimservice/frozen
```

For the full Kind suite, install the operator in the cluster with the Kind
values and use the local Zot-backed target:

```bash
make kind-create
make helm
helm upgrade --install aim-engine dist/chart \
  --namespace aim-system \
  --create-namespace \
  -f hack/kind/operator-values.yaml \
  --set acceleratorDetector.enable=false
make test-chainsaw-kind-zot KIND_CLUSTER=aim-engine
```

`make kind-create` installs an ephemeral Zot registry with a cert-manager-issued
TLS certificate. The test target builds `aim-dummy` once, pushes every fixture
tag through a temporary localhost port-forward, and kind-loads the exact
in-cluster references used by workload pods. The operator trusts the private CA
through `hack/kind/operator-values.yaml`; normal public certificate roots remain
available.

The Zot service name is only resolvable inside the cluster. Run this target
against an operator installed in Kind, rather than an operator started on the
host with `make watch`.

### Environment Selectors

Tests are filtered by environment. When `ENV=kind` (default), tests tagged with `requires=longhorn` or other infrastructure requirements are excluded automatically.

### Credentials for opt-in tests

Some GPU tests need a private-registry pull secret that is not universally provisioned. These tests are tagged with `needs-secret: dockerhub_pull_secret` and excluded from the default selectors. The shared `tests/e2e/_shared/ensure-pull-secret.sh` helper resolves the secret at runtime in this order:

1. A local Secret manifest under `~/.config/aim-engine/` (path overridable via env).
2. An identically-named secret in the `default` namespace, copied into the test namespace (provision once per shared cluster).
3. Otherwise it warns and continues, unless `PULL_SECRET_REQUIRED=1` is set.

| Secret | Default local path | Path override | Secret name / key |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Docker Hub pull secret | `~/.config/aim-engine/dockerhub-regcred.yaml` | `DOCKERHUB_PULL_SECRET_FILE` | `dockerhub-regcred` (`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`) |

Create it once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/aim-engine

# Docker Hub pull secret (private docker.io/silogenai images).
# The manifest must NOT pin a namespace — the helper applies it with -n <test-ns>.
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub-regcred \
  --docker-server=docker.io \
  --docker-username=<user> --docker-password=<token-or-password> \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml > ~/.config/aim-engine/dockerhub-regcred.yaml
```

Or create the same-named pull secret in the `default` namespace and the helper will copy it in.

Useful overrides: `PULL_SECRET_SOURCE_NS` changes the copy-from namespace, and `PULL_SECRET_REQUIRED=1` makes a missing pull secret fail instead of warn.

#### Authenticated Hugging Face tests

Tests that can contact Hugging Face carry `hf-access: live`. A shared Chainsaw step template creates `huggingface-creds` inside each test's ephemeral namespace before any downloader resource is applied, preserving per-test log and metrics isolation. When `HF_TOKEN` is set, those requests are authenticated; without it, public-model tests continue to exercise anonymous access. Tests labeled `needs-secret: hf_token` remain excluded from the normal environment suites because they cannot reasonably run without credentials. The deliberate authentication-failure test is labeled `hf-access: anonymous` and never provisions the shared secret.

```bash
read -rsp "HF token: " HF_TOKEN
echo
export HF_TOKEN
make test-chainsaw ENV=kind
# On a matching environment, run only tests where a token is a hard prerequisite:
make test-chainsaw-hf ENV=gpu
unset HF_TOKEN
```

`needs-secret: hf_token` is reserved for tests that cannot reasonably run without credentials, such as gated or unusually large models. `test-chainsaw-hf` selects that lane by labels across the full test tree. Trusted CI passes `HF_TOKEN` to the normal suite as well, so ordinary services whose official AIM metadata contains implicit `hf://` sources are authenticated without moving them into the opt-in lane. Trusted runs fail if the repository secret is missing; GitHub does not expose it to fork PRs.

#### Running a `needs-secret` test

The `needs-secret` exclusion lives in the ENV selector, so pointing `CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR` at the directory is **not** enough — it would still be filtered out (`0 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped`). Clear the selector to opt in:

```bash
make test-chainsaw \
  CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR=tests/e2e/aimservice/gpu/v1alpha2-profile-via-model-cpu-live \
  CHAINSAW_ENV_SELECTOR=
```

### Runtime projection mode tests (`Reduced`)

Eager runtime projection is governed by the operator flag `--runtime-projection-mode` (`Exhaustive` default / `Reduced` / `Both`; see [ADR 0008](../../adr/0008-runtime-projection-from-profiles.md)). The default lane always runs the operator in `Exhaustive`, so tests whose assertions only hold in a non-default mode are gated with `requires: reduced-mode` (Reduced) and excluded from both ENV selectors.

`Both` mode has no dedicated e2e coverage of its own: it is the pure additive union of Exhaustive + Reduced (there is no `Both`-only code path — the per-profile and model-slug plan branches fire independently), so the `Exhaustive` and `Reduced` legs already exercise both projection outputs, and each additionally asserts the mutually-exclusive *absence* of the other mode's runtime — something a `Both` run structurally cannot. `Both`'s one unique property (both runtimes coexist for a single profile) is pinned cheaply by the Both-mode unit tests in `internal/v1alpha2/aimprofile/runtime_projection_test.go`.

To run the Reduced tests, first redeploy the operator in Reduced (no rebuild needed — the flag is compiled in), then point `CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR` at the specific mode directory with the selector cleared:

```bash
# Reduced
make set-projection-mode MODE=Reduced
make test-chainsaw \
  CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR=tests/e2e/v1alpha2/runtime-projection/mode-reduced \
  CHAINSAW_ENV_SELECTOR=

# Restore the operator to the default when finished
make set-projection-mode MODE=Exhaustive
```

`make set-projection-mode` patches the in-cluster operator Deployment's `--runtime-projection-mode` arg and waits for the rollout, so it works against a kustomize/Tilt dev deploy as well as a Helm install (override `OPERATOR_NAMESPACE` / `OPERATOR_DEPLOYMENT` if they differ). Point `CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR` at exactly one mode directory: the `mode-reduced` fixture asserts the Reduced shape and only passes against a Reduced operator. The `mode-exhaustive` smoke needs no gate and runs in the default lane.

For a Helm install, set the equivalent value instead: `--set manager.runtimeProjectionMode=Reduced`.

To run **all** the gated tests for the mode in one shot (instead of pointing `CHAINSAW_TEST_DIR` at each directory), use `make test-chainsaw-projection-mode MODE=Reduced`. It is the inverse of the default lanes' exclusion: it points at `tests/e2e/v1alpha2/runtime-projection` and flips the selector to *include* `requires in (reduced-mode)`, so only the matching gated tests load. Set the operator to that mode first (Helm value or `make set-projection-mode`).

CI exercises these otherwise-CI-dark paths: `.github/workflows/test-e2e.yml` runs the e2e job as a matrix over `runtime-projection-mode: [Exhaustive, Reduced]`. The `Exhaustive` leg is the full default suite (gated tests excluded); the `Reduced` leg installs the operator with `manager.runtimeProjectionMode` set, asserts the live arg, and runs only the mode-gated tests via `make test-chainsaw-projection-mode`.

### Test Reports

JSON reports are written to `.tmp/chainsaw-reports/chainsaw-report.json`. Analyze failures:

```bash
# List failed tests
jq -r '.tests[] | select(.steps[].operations[].failure) | .name' \
  .tmp/chainsaw-reports/chainsaw-report.json | sort -u

# Get failure details
jq -r '.tests[] | select(.steps[].operations[].failure) |
  {name, failures: [.steps[].operations[] | select(.failure) | .failure.error]}' \
  .tmp/chainsaw-reports/chainsaw-report.json
```

### Correlating with Operator Logs

Chainsaw creates unique namespaces like `chainsaw-<adjective>-<noun>` for each test. Extract the namespace from test failures and search operator logs:

```bash
LOG=$(ls -t .tmp/logs/air-*.log | head -1)
grep "chainsaw-<namespace>" "$LOG"
```

## Writing Tests

### Test Structure

```
tests/e2e/my-feature/
  chainsaw-test.yaml    # Test definition
  resource.yaml         # Resources to apply
  assert.yaml           # Expected state assertions
```

### Example Test

```yaml
apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: basic-service
spec:
  steps:
    - try:
        - apply:
            file: service.yaml
        - assert:
            file: assert.yaml
            timeout: 120s
```

### Debug Simulation

For tests that involve model downloads, use simulation mode to avoid real network calls:

```yaml
env:
  - name: AIM_DEBUG_SIMULATE_HF_DOWNLOAD
    value: "true"
  - name: AIM_DEBUG_SIMULATE_HF_DURATION
    value: "2"
```

## Test Directories

Key e2e test areas:

| Directory | What it tests |
|-----------|--------------|
| `tests/e2e/aimmodel/fine-tuned/` | aimId-based template matching for fine-tuned models |
| `tests/e2e/aimmodel/custom-models/` | Custom models with explicit hardware and modelSources |
| `tests/e2e/aimservicetemplate/` | Template discovery, inline sources, GPU availability |
| `tests/e2e/aimservice/` | Full service lifecycle including frozen models and GPU tests |
| `tests/e2e/aimartifact/` | Model artifact downloads, quotas, and protocols |

Run a specific test area:

```bash
make test-chainsaw CHAINSAW_ARGS="--test-dir tests/e2e/aimmodel/fine-tuned"
```

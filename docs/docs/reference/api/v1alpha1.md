#### AIMAdapterDisk



AIMAdapterDisk configures the shared, RWX adapter disk provisioned alongside a
model artifact. When present on a type=model artifact, the controller provisions
a second PersistentVolumeClaim (ReadWriteMany) owned by the model artifact and
shared by every AIMService that serves adapters on this base model.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMArtifactSpec](#aimartifactspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `size` _[Quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#quantity-resource-api)_ | Size is the requested size of the adapter disk PVC.<br />Defaults to 50Gi when unset (a cascade default may override it). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `storageClassName` _string_ | StorageClassName specifies the storage class for the adapter disk.<br />When empty, the cluster default storage class is used.<br />The access mode is fixed at ReadWriteMany by the controller. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### AIMAdapterMode

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMAdapterMode selects the adapter contract for the service. Its values are
the lowercase tokens the inference container reads via the AIM_ADAPTER_MODE
env, and the field is immutable after creation.
  - static (default): the served set is fixed at creation — spec.adapters is
    CEL-immutable. The adapter disk is mounted read-only only when the service
    declares at least one adapter.
  - dynamic: spec.adapters may be edited after creation; the runtime
    hot-loads/unloads from the mounted subtree. The adapter disk is mounted
    (immutably) whenever the service is in dynamic mode — even at zero adapters
    — so add/remove never restarts the pod.

A service serves no adapters by simply declaring none: the default-static,
no-adapters case mounts nothing.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [static dynamic]

_Appears in:_
- [AIMServiceSpec](#aimservicespec)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `static` | AdapterModeStatic fixes the adapter set at creation; the disk is mounted<br />only when adapters are declared.<br /> |
| `dynamic` | AdapterModeDynamic permits editing spec.adapters and mounts the disk even<br />at zero adapters.<br /> |


#### AIMAdapterState

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMAdapterState is the disk-side lifecycle state of an adapter within a service's
subtree. The controller tracks staging and removal directly; the engine-reported
states (Loaded/LoadRejected) are reserved until the inference container exposes a
per-adapter load-status surface.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Pending Downloading Downloaded Deleting Loaded LoadRejected]

_Appears in:_
- [AIMServiceAdapterStatus](#aimserviceadapterstatus)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Pending` | AdapterStatePending means the adapter is applied and waiting on a precondition.<br /> |
| `Downloading` | AdapterStateDownloading means a staging Job is running for this adapter.<br /> |
| `Downloaded` | AdapterStateDownloaded means the bytes are staged in this service's subtree.<br /> |
| `Deleting` | AdapterStateDeleting means the adapter was removed from spec.adapters and its<br />bytes are being reclaimed from the service subtree by the subtree-sync Job.<br />The entry is dropped from status once the prune completes.<br /> |
| `Loaded` | AdapterStateLoaded means the inference engine has the adapter in memory.<br />RESERVED: engine-reported, not yet populated by the controller.<br /> |
| `LoadRejected` | AdapterStateLoadRejected means the bytes are present but the engine declined<br />to load the adapter. RESERVED: engine-reported, not yet populated.<br /> |


#### AIMArtifact



AIMArtifact is the Schema for the artifacts API

If not set, artifacts without an explicit<br />retentionPriority are never automatically evicted. |  | Minimum: 0 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `modelDownloadImage` _string_ | ModelDownloadImage specifies the default container image for artifact<br />download and size-check jobs. Applies when an AIMArtifact does not set<br />spec.modelDownloadImage. When neither is set, the operator falls back<br />to its build-time default (matching the release version).

| `s3` _[S3ConnectionConfig](#s3connectionconfig)_ | S3 configures typed connection settings for AIMArtifacts whose sourceUri<br />uses the s3:// scheme. RuntimeConfig env remains available for<br />administrator-owned infrastructure settings, while artifact-level env is<br />restricted to bounded downloader tuning.

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMArtifactType discriminates a model artifact from a LoRA adapter artifact.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [model adapter]

_Appears in:_
- [AIMArtifactSpec](#aimartifactspec)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | ArtifactTypeModel is a base model artifact backed by a cache PVC. This is the<br />default and matches the behavior of artifacts created before adapters existed.<br /> |
| `adapter` | ArtifactTypeAdapter is a LoRA adapter definition. Adapter artifacts do not get<br />their own cache PVC; their bytes are staged per-consuming-service into the<br />parent model artifact's adapter disk.<br /> |


#### AIMCachingMode

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMCachingMode controls caching behavior for a service.
Canonical values are Dedicated and Shared.
Legacy values are accepted for backward compatibility:

#### AIMClusterModel



AIMClusterModel is a cluster-scoped model catalog entry for AIM container images.

Cluster-scoped models can be referenced by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
shared model deployments across teams and projects. Like namespace-scoped AIMModels, cluster models
trigger discovery jobs to extract metadata and generate service templates.

When both cluster and namespace models exist for the same container image, services will preferentially
use the namespace-scoped AIMModel when referenced by image URI.

| `imagePullSecrets` _[LocalObjectReference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#localobjectreference-v1-core) array_ | ImagePullSecrets contains references to secrets for authenticating to private registries.<br />Secrets must exist in the operator namespace (typically aim-system).<br />Used for both registry catalog listing and image metadata extraction. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `filters` _[ModelSourceFilter](#modelsourcefilter) array_ | Filters define which images to discover and sync.<br />Each filter specifies an image selector with optional version constraints and exclusions.<br />Multiple filters are combined with OR logic (any match includes the image).<br />Use this field for advanced matching options. For simple explicit image lists, use Images instead. |  | MaxItems: 100 <br />MinItems: 1 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `images` _string array_ | Images defines a simple explicit list of images to discover and sync.<br />Use this for straightforward static declarations without per-filter options.<br />Supported image formats:<br />- Repository with tag: "amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b:0.8.4"<br />- Repository without tag: "amdenterpriseai/aim-qwen-qwen3-32b" (uses Versions if set)<br />- Full URI with tag: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-llama:1.0.0"<br />Must not be set together with Filters. |  | MaxItems: 100 <br />MinItems: 1 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `versions` _string array_ | Versions specifies global semantic version constraints applied to all filters.<br />Individual filters can override this with their own version constraints.<br />Constraints use semver syntax: >=1.0.0, <2.0.0, ~1.2.0, ^1.0.0, etc.<br />Non-semver tags (e.g., "latest", "dev") are silently skipped.<br />Version ranges work on all registries (including ghcr.io, gcr.io) when combined with<br />exact repository names (no wildcards). The controller uses the Tags List API to fetch<br />all tags for the repository and filters them by the semver constraint.<br />Example: registry=ghcr.io, filters=[\{image: "silogen/aim-llama"\}], versions=[">=1.0.0"]<br />will fetch all tags from ghcr.io/silogen/aim-llama and include only those >=1.0.0. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `maxModels` _integer_ | MaxModels is the maximum number of AIMClusterModel resources to create from this source.<br />Once this limit is reached, no new models will be created, even if more matching images are discovered.<br />Existing models are never deleted.<br />This prevents runaway model creation from overly broad filters. | 100 | Maximum: 10000 <br />Minimum: 1 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |

#### AIMClusterRuntimeConfig



AIMClusterRuntimeConfig is a cluster-scoped runtime configuration for AIM services, models, and templates.

Cluster-scoped runtime configs provide platform-wide defaults that apply to all namespaces,
making them ideal for organization-level policies such as storage classes, discovery behavior,
model creation scope, and routing configuration.

When both cluster and namespace runtime configs exist with the same name, the configs are merged, and
the namespace-scoped AIMRuntimeConfig takes precedence for any field that is set in both.

#### AIMClusterServiceTemplate



AIMClusterServiceTemplate is a cluster-scoped template that defines runtime profiles for AIM services.

Cluster-scoped templates can be used by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
platform-wide model configurations that should be shared across teams and projects.
Unlike namespace-scoped AIMServiceTemplates, cluster templates do not support caching configuration
and must be managed by cluster administrators, since caches themselves are namespace-scoped.

When both cluster and namespace templates exist with the same name, the namespace-scoped template
takes precedence for services in that namespace.

AIMDownloadFilter controls which files are included or excluded during artifact downloads.
Patterns use fnmatch-style glob syntax applied against relative file paths in the repository.
Both the size estimator and downloader apply the same filter, ensuring PVC sizing matches the actual download.

Filter order (matching huggingface_hub behavior):
 1. Include: if set, only files matching at least one include pattern are considered
 2. Exclude: files matching any exclude pattern are then removed

When no filter is configured (neither on the artifact nor in the runtime config),
subdirectory files are excluded by default (equivalent to exclude: ["*/*"]).
To download all files including subdirectories, set an empty filter: downloadFilter: {}.

#### AIMModelDiscoveryConfig



AIMModelDiscoveryConfig controls discovery behavior for a model.

The bool fields are pointers so the schema can distinguish "unset" from
explicit false. With a plain bool + omitempty + default=true, the API
server's OpenAPI defaulter cannot tell an explicit false apart from a
missing field (both look like the Go zero value) and silently rewrites
the explicit false to true. Pointers preserve the user's intent.

#### AIMModelKind

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMModelKind classifies the v1alpha2 AIMModel onboarding flow that
produced this model's profiles. Populated by the v1alpha2 controller
during reconciliation from the model's spec shape.

The three kinds correspond 1:1 to the "three flows" documented in
concepts/models.md:

  - Image    — spec.image is set; profiles come from in-cluster image
    discovery on that image. Covers both AMD-published official AIMs
    and any private image with profile YAMLs baked in (including
    base images used as source material for Custom-kind models).
  - Derived  — spec.profiles.derivedFrom with selector.role unset or
    "deployable"; profiles are re-derived from another deployable
    model's profiles (e.g. fine-tunes that swap weights but keep
    the original model's architecture, runtime, and accelerator
    shapes).
  - Custom   — spec.profiles.derivedFrom with selector.role=base;
    profiles are derived by overlaying BYO weights + target identity
    onto a base image's generic base profiles.

Empty when the spec hasn't been classified yet (controller hasn't
reconciled) or when the spec shape doesn't match any of the three
flows (a misconfigured spec the CEL validators didn't catch).

#### AIMModelProfilesSpec



AIMModelProfilesSpec is the v1alpha2 AIMModel onboarding surface for
profile-derivation flows. It groups the source descriptor, version filter,
and overrides under one block so the spec reads "the model's profiles,
derived from <source>, with <overrides> applied".

The reconciler translates this block into a child AIMProfileSet:
  - DerivedFrom.Selector / DerivedFrom.SourceRef → child AIMProfileSet
    spec.selector / spec.sourceRef.
  - VersionPolicy / Version → child spec.versionPolicy / spec.version.

#### AIMModelSourceType

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMModelSourceType indicates how a model's artifacts are sourced.

Only set by the v1alpha1 controller, which lumps fine-tunes and custom
models together as "Custom" — losing the distinction users actually
care about. The v1alpha2 controller intentionally does not populate
this field on v1alpha2-shaped specs; v1alpha2 consumers should read
AIMModelStatus.Kind instead, which is a three-way classifier
(Image / Derived / Custom).

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Image Custom]

_Appears in:_
- [AIMModelStatus](#aimmodelstatus)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Image` | AIMModelSourceTypeImage indicates the model is discovered from container image labels.<br /> |
| `Custom` | AIMModelSourceTypeCustom indicates the model uses explicit spec.modelSources.<br /> |


#### AIMModelSpec



AIMModelSpec defines the desired state of AIMModel.

Per-version constraints (v1alpha1 forbids derivedFrom and profiles;
v1alpha2 forbids profileCopy/custom/customTemplates/top-level modelSources,
requires image XOR profiles, and forbids profiles mixed with legacy scalar
fields) live on the version-specific AIMModel / AIMClusterModel root types
in the per-version *_types.go files.

| `image` _string_ | Image is the container image URI for this AIM model.<br />This image is inspected by the operator to select runtime profiles used by templates.<br />Discovery behavior is controlled by the discovery field and runtime config's AutoDiscovery setting.<br />Required unless aimId is set with versionPolicy latest or any, or profileCopy is set. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `aimId` _string_ | AimId is the AIM product family identifier (e.g., "qwen/qwen3-32b").<br />When set together with modelSources, enables aimId-based template matching:<br />the controller finds official templates by aimId, filters by versionPolicy,<br />matches by modelId, and creates copies with the custom weight source. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `profileCopy` _[AIMProfileSetSpec](#aimprofilesetspec)_ | ProfileCopy reuses the AIMProfileSet derivation shape so an AIMModel can<br />publish derivative AIMProfiles directly. The controller may synthesize a<br />child AIMProfileSet and fill SourceRef when image-backed discovery is<br />involved. Mutually exclusive with all deprecated v1alpha1 fields.<br />DEPRECATED on v1alpha2: use spec.profiles. v1alpha1 still accepts<br />ProfileCopy. v1alpha2 CRD CEL forbids ProfileCopy. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `derivedFrom` _[AIMProfileSetSpec](#aimprofilesetspec)_ | DerivedFrom is the legacy flat shape of v1alpha2's profile-derivation<br />onboarding surface. New objects must use spec.profiles instead; the<br />field is retained so existing v1alpha2 objects (and the v1alpha2<br />reconciler reading them) round-trip cleanly.<br />DEPRECATED: prefer spec.profiles.derivedFrom on v1alpha2. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

When set, the AIMModel<br />reconciler synthesises a child AIMProfileSet from this block.<br />Mutually exclusive with spec.image (exactly one of the two is required<br />for v1alpha2 AIMModel). v1alpha1 rejects spec.profiles via per-version<br />CEL. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `modelSources` _[AIMModelSource](#aimmodelsource) array_ | ModelSources specifies the model sources to use for this model.<br />When specified, these sources are used instead of auto-discovery from the container image.<br />This enables pre-creating custom models with explicit model sources.<br />The size field is optional - if not specified, it will be discovered by the download job.<br />AIM runtime currently supports only one model source. |  | MaxItems: 1 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `runtimeConfigName` _string_ | Name is the name of the runtime config to use for this resource. If a runtime config with this name exists both<br />as a namespace and a cluster runtime config, the values are merged together, the namespace config taking priority<br />over the cluster config when there are conflicts. If this field is empty or set to `default`, the namespace / cluster<br />runtime config with the name `default` is used, if it exists. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `env` _[EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#envvar-v1-core) array_ | Env specifies environment variables for authentication during model discovery and metadata extraction.<br />These variables are used for authentication with model registries (e.g., HuggingFace tokens). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `resources` _[ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#resourcerequirements-v1-core)_ | Resources defines the default resource requirements for services using this model.<br />Template- or service-level values override these defaults. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `imageMetadata` _[ImageMetadata](#imagemetadata)_ | ImageMetadata is the metadata that is used to determine which recommended service templates to create,<br />and to drive clients with richer metadata regarding this particular model. For most cases the user does<br />not need to set this field manually, for images that have the supported labels embedded in them<br />the `AIM(Cluster)Model.status.imageMetadata` field is automatically filled from the container image labels.<br />This field is intended to be used when there are network restrictions, or in other similar situations.<br />If this field is set, the remote extraction will not be performed at all. |  |  |

Empty for models that have no<br />spec.image (e.g. fine-tuned models derived from a parent) or that<br />reference an image by digest.<br />This mirrors AIMProfileStatus.Version so the two surfaces stay in<br />lock-step: a single image-tag extraction rule governs what users<br />see in the kubectl printcolumn for both kinds.<br />The image-author-declared version (i.e. the<br />`org.opencontainers.image.version` OCI label) is preserved separately<br />under .status.imageMetadata.oci.version for users that want to inspect<br />what the image build pipeline stamped.

| `general` | AIMProfileTypeGeneral indicates a general-purpose profile (between optimized and preview).<br /> |
| `preview` | AIMProfileTypePreview indicates the profile is in preview/beta state.<br /> |
| `unoptimized` | AIMProfileTypeUnoptimized indicates the profile has not been optimized.<br /> |
| `any` | AIMProfileTypeAny is a selector-only sentinel meaning "no optimization<br />floor — accept every tier". It is never stamped on a profile's own<br />spec.type; it is only valid as a ProfileSelector.minimumType value, where<br />it disables the floor (equivalent to flooring at unoptimized, the lowest<br />tier, but reads as intent rather than asking specifically for unoptimized).<br /> |


#### AIMProfileTypeFloor

_Underlying type:_ _string_

AIMProfileTypeFloor enumerates the values accepted by a profile selector's
minimumType floor: the real optimization tiers plus the selector-only "any"
sentinel that disables the floor.

It is a distinct type from AIMProfileType on purpose. MinimumType cannot just
be an AIMProfileType: that type's own enum constrains a profile's spec.type to
the four real tiers (a profile is never "any"), and a field whose type already
declares an enum cannot widen it — controller-gen emits an allOf of the two
enums, whose intersection silently drops "any" and makes the documented
sentinel un-settable. A separate type carries the correct 5-value enum for the
floor while leaving spec.type constrained to real tiers.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [optimized general preview unoptimized any]

| `preview` | AIMProfileTypeFloorPreview floors selection at preview.<br /> |
| `unoptimized` | AIMProfileTypeFloorUnoptimized floors selection at unoptimized (the<br />lowest real tier — admits every typed profile).<br /> |

#### AIMRuntimeParameters



AIMRuntimeParameters contains the runtime configuration parameters shared
across templates and services. Fields use pointers to allow optional usage
in different contexts (required in templates, optional in service overrides).

#### AIMRuntimeRoutingConfig



AIMRuntimeRoutingConfig configures HTTP routing defaults for inference services.
These settings control how Gateway API HTTPRoutes are created and configured.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMClusterRuntimeConfigSpec](#aimclusterruntimeconfigspec)
- [AIMRuntimeConfigCommon](#aimruntimeconfigcommon)
- [AIMRuntimeConfigSpec](#aimruntimeconfigspec)
- [AIMServiceRuntimeConfig](#aimserviceruntimeconfig)
- [AIMServiceSpec](#aimservicespec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` _boolean_ | Enabled controls whether HTTP routing is managed for inference services using this config.<br />When true, the operator creates HTTPRoute resources for services that reference this config.<br />When false or unset, routing must be explicitly enabled on each service.<br />This provides a namespace or cluster-wide default that individual services can override. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `gatewayRef` _[ParentReference](#parentreference)_ | GatewayRef specifies the Gateway API Gateway resource that should receive HTTPRoutes.<br />This identifies the parent gateway for routing traffic to inference services.<br />The gateway can be in any namespace (cross-namespace references are supported).<br />If routing is enabled but GatewayRef is not specified, service reconciliation will fail<br />with a validation error. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `hostnames` _Hostname array_ | Hostnames pins generated HTTPRoutes to these hostnames so a route only<br />attaches to the matching Gateway listener instead of every listener on<br />the parent gateway. Without a hostname, an HTTPRoute matches all of the<br />parent gateway's listener hostnames, which can expose a service on<br />listeners that do not enforce the intended authentication.<br />This field is required when the parent gateway exposes more than one<br />listener: in that case a service with routing enabled but no hostnames<br />configured will not get an HTTPRoute and reports ConfigValid=False with<br />reason RouteHostnameRequired. When the parent gateway has a single<br />listener, leaving this empty preserves the existing behavior (the route<br />inherits that listener's hostnames).<br />Individual services can override this list via spec.routing.hostnames. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `pathTemplate` _string_ | PathTemplate defines the HTTP path template for routes, evaluated using JSONPath expressions.<br />The template is rendered against the AIMService object to generate unique paths.<br />Example templates:<br />- `/\{.metadata.namespace\}/\{.metadata.name\}` - namespace and service name<br />- `/\{.metadata.namespace\}/\{.metadata.labels['team']\}/inference` - with label<br />- `/models/\{.metadata.name\}` - based on service name<br />The template must:<br />- Use valid JSONPath expressions wrapped in \{...\}<br />- Reference fields that exist on the service<br />- Produce a path ≤ 200 characters after rendering<br />- Result in valid URL path segments (lowercase, RFC 1123 compliant)<br />If evaluation fails, the service enters Degraded state with PathTemplateInvalid reason.<br />Individual services can override this template via spec.routing.pathTemplate. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `requestTimeout` _[Duration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#duration-v1-meta)_ | RequestTimeout defines the HTTP request timeout for routes.<br />This sets the maximum duration for a request to complete before timing out.<br />The timeout applies to the entire request/response cycle.<br />If not specified, no timeout is set on the route.<br />Individual services can override this value via spec.routing.requestTimeout. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations defines default annotations to add to all HTTPRoute resources.<br />Services can add additional annotations or override these via spec.routing.annotations.<br />When both are specified, service annotations take precedence for conflicting keys.<br />Common use cases include ingress controller settings, rate limiting, monitoring labels,<br />and security policies that should apply to all services using this config. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### AIMService



AIMService manages a KServe-based AIM inference service for the selected model and template.
Note: KServe uses {name}-{namespace} format which must not exceed 63 characters.
This constraint is validated at runtime since CEL cannot access metadata.namespace.

| --- | --- |
| `AIMArtifact` | AdapterKindAIMArtifact references an AIMArtifact (type=adapter).<br /> |


#### AIMServiceAdapterReference



AIMServiceAdapterReference is a typed reference to a LoRA adapter served by this
service. Today it is resolved as a pure reference to an existing adapter
artifact. The inline bootstrap fields (sourceUri/modelId/rank) are reserved:
the schema accepts them, but create-if-missing self-healing is not yet wired,
so a referenced adapter artifact must currently exist.



_Appears in:_

| `lastError` _string_ | LastError carries the most recent error for this adapter (e.g. a mirrored<br />failing reason from the underlying artifact). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### AIMServiceAutoScaling



AIMServiceAutoScaling configures KEDA-based autoscaling with custom metrics.
This enables automatic scaling based on metrics collected from OpenTelemetry.
A present autoScaling block must carry at least one real setting: a fully
empty block is a partially-complete spec that yields no usable configuration,
so it is rejected. Omit the whole block to use default scaling instead. Any
single valid sub-field (metrics, pollingInterval, or cooldownPeriod) is enough.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMServiceSpec](#aimservicespec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metrics` _[AIMServiceMetricsSpec](#aimservicemetricsspec) array_ | Metrics is a list of metrics to be used for autoscaling.<br />Each metric defines a source (PodMetric) and target values. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `pollingInterval` _integer_ | PollingInterval is the KEDA polling interval in seconds. Defaults to 5<br />when spec.minReplicas == 0 (so a single request reliably activates the<br />deployment within ~10s); otherwise unset (KEDA default of 30 applies). |  | Minimum: 1 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `cooldownPeriod` _integer_ | CooldownPeriod is the seconds-of-inactivity budget KEDA waits before<br />scaling back to minReplicaCount. Under scale-to-zero, defaults to a<br />memory-derived value (300-1200s); otherwise unset (KEDA default of 300). |  | Minimum: 0 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### AIMServiceCacheStatus



AIMServiceCacheStatus captures cache-related status for an AIMService.

Exactly one of TemplateCacheRef / ProfileCacheRef is populated, depending on
which reconciliation path produced the cache:
  - TemplateCacheRef is set by the v1alpha1 (template-based) path and points
    to an AIMTemplateCache.
  - ProfileCacheRef is set by the v1alpha2 (profile-based) path and points to
    an AIMProfileCache.

| `retryAttempts` _integer_ | RetryAttempts tracks how many times this service has attempted to retry a failed cache.<br />Each service gets exactly one retry attempt. When a cache enters Failed state,<br />this counter is incremented from 0 to 1 after deleting failed Artifacts.<br />If the retry fails (cache enters Failed again with attempts == 1), the service degrades. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `env` _[EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#envvar-v1-core) array_ | Env supplies credentials for model downloads (for example a HuggingFace<br />token via secretKeyRef). Unlike the inference container env, these<br />variables reach only the model-download Job, so download-only secrets are<br />never injected into the serving container. They are also reachable for<br />cluster-scoped and overlay profiles, where the profile's own caching.env<br />does not exist. Merged over the profile's caching.env (service wins). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

#### AIMServiceMetricTarget



AIMServiceMetricTarget defines the target value for a metric.
Specifies how the metric value should be interpreted and what target to maintain.
The value field that matches the chosen type must be set, otherwise the
target carries no threshold and the scaler cannot make a decision.

| `name` _string_ | Name references an existing AIMModel or AIMClusterModel by metadata.name.<br />The controller looks for a namespace-scoped AIMModel first, then falls back to cluster-scoped AIMClusterModel.<br />Example: `meta-llama-3-8b` |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `image` _string_ | Image specifies a container image URI directly.<br />The controller searches for an existing model with this image, or creates one if none exists.<br />Auto-created models are namespace-scoped and can be reused by other services.<br />Example: `ghcr.io/silogen/llama-3-8b:v1.2.0` |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `hardware` _[AIMHardwareRequirements](#aimhardwarerequirements)_ | Hardware specifies the GPU and CPU requirements for this custom model.<br />GPU is optional - if not set, no GPUs are requested (CPU-only model). |  | Required: \{\} <br /> |


#### AIMServiceOverrides



AIMServiceOverrides allows overriding template parameters at the service level.
All fields are optional. When specified, they override the corresponding values
from the referenced AIMServiceTemplate.

| `target` _[AIMServiceMetricTarget](#aimservicemetrictarget)_ | Target specifies the target value for the metric.<br />The autoscaler will scale to maintain this target value. |  |  |


#### AIMServiceProfileConfig



AIMServiceProfileConfig contains profile selection configuration for AIMService v1alpha2.
When set, the service uses a profile-based reconciliation path instead of the template path.

Exactly one of Name and Selector must be set. Name resolves an AIMProfile /
AIMClusterProfile directly; Selector lists candidates by provenance and spec
fields (typically combined with `spec.model.name`, which the controller
treats as a shortcut for `selector.modelRef.name`).

An empty `name` ("") is treated as unset, so the rules below are value-based
(`size(self.name) > 0`) rather than presence-based (`has(self.name)`).



_Appears in:_
- [AIMServiceSpec](#aimservicespec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the name of the AIMProfile or AIMClusterProfile to use.<br />The controller looks for a namespace-scoped AIMProfile first, then falls back to AIMClusterProfile.<br />Mutually exclusive with Selector. An empty string is treated as unset. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `selector` _[ProfileSelector](#profileselector)_ | Selector narrows candidate AIMProfile / AIMClusterProfile objects via the<br />shared provenance labels (role, source-model, origin) and spec filters<br />(aimId, precision, acceleratorModel, ...). The controller forces<br />`selector.role = Deployable` at evaluation time; user-supplied values<br />for that field are rejected by CEL on v1alpha2.<br />For every selector-driven AIMService the controller requires at least<br />one of `selector.aimId` or `selector.modelRef.name` so the watch<br />fan-out can reach the service via an O(1) index lookup. The top-level<br />`spec.model.name` shortcut is treated as if the user had set<br />`selector.modelRef.name` to the same value when not explicit. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### AIMServiceProfileOverrides



AIMServiceProfileOverrides allows overriding profile parameters at the service level.
When specified, the controller materialises a service-owned overlay AIMProfile
derived from the referenced profile with these overrides applied; the original
profile is not modified. The downstream AIMProfileCache and InferenceService are
then resolved from the overlay, so the override participates in cache key
computation as well as inference-pod env wiring.

This type is a SUBSET of `aimv1alpha1.ProfileOverrides` (the type
AIMProfileSet derivation uses). Both go through the same internal apply
primitive (`internal/v1alpha2/aimprofile.ApplyProfileCopyOverrides`) so
the merge semantics match, but the service-level overlay intentionally
omits the `Image` override that AIMProfileSet's overrides expose:
changing the runtime container image per-service belongs at the profile
level (via spec.profiles.overrides.image on the source AIMModel /
AIMProfileSet), not at the consumer. Restricting the field set here
keeps the per-service overlay focused on workload-shape changes
(weights, env, args, hardware count) where service-level overrides are
the right tool.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMServiceSpec](#aimservicespec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `modelSources` _[AIMModelSource](#aimmodelsource) array_ | ModelSources replaces the referenced profile's modelSources entirely.<br />Use this to point a profile at user-supplied weights (e.g. a fine-tuned<br />checkpoint) without forking the profile itself. The first source's<br />modelId becomes the overlay profile's modelId. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorModel` _string_ | AcceleratorModel replaces the referenced profile's acceleratorModel<br />(e.g. "MI300X" -> "MI325X"). Validation against actual cluster<br />availability is left to the AIMServiceTemplate / runtime layers. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorCount` _integer_ | AcceleratorCount replaces the referenced profile's acceleratorCount. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorPartitioningMode` _string_ | AcceleratorPartitioningMode replaces the referenced profile's<br />acceleratorPartitioningMode. Complete replacement, not a merge — single<br />string, no substruct ambiguity. Empty string means "no override" (the<br />resolved overlay inherits the base profile's mode). Use this to deploy a<br />profile written for whole GPUs onto a partition slice. Whenever this<br />override is set (to any value, including "unpartitioned"), the CEL rule on<br />AIMService also requires an acceleratorCount override: partition mode<br />changes the per-unit interpretation of acceleratorCount, and CEL cannot<br />read the base profile to tell whether the meaning actually changed, so it<br />conservatively requires the count be restated.

This struct is shared between AIMService.spec (inlined) and AIMRuntimeConfigCommon,
allowing services to override these specific runtime settings while inheriting defaults
from namespace/cluster RuntimeConfigs.

#### AIMServiceSpec



AIMServiceSpec defines the desired state of AIMService.

Binds a canonical model to an AIMServiceTemplate and configures replicas,
caching behavior, and optional overrides. The template governs the base
runtime selection knobs, while the overrides field allows service-specific
customization.

With v1alpha2, a Profile can be used instead of a Template. Template and Profile
are mutually exclusive — at least one resolution path must be specified.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMService](#aimservice)

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` _[AIMServiceModel](#aimservicemodel)_ | Model specifies which model to deploy using one of the available reference methods.<br />Use `name` to reference an existing AIMModel/AIMClusterModel by name, or use `image`<br />to specify a container image URI directly (which will auto-create a model if needed).<br />Required for v1alpha1 (template path), not permitted for v1alpha2 (profile path). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `template` _[AIMServiceTemplateConfig](#aimservicetemplateconfig)_ | Template contains template selection and configuration.<br />Use Template.Name to specify an explicit template, or omit to auto-select.<br />Mutually exclusive with Profile (v1alpha2). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `profile` _[AIMServiceProfileConfig](#aimserviceprofileconfig)_ | Profile contains profile selection configuration (v1alpha2 only).<br />When set, the service uses a profile-based reconciliation path.<br />Mutually exclusive with Template. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |

In dynamic mode the list may<br />be edited after creation: adding an adapter stages it into the service's<br />subtree and the aim-runtime hot-loads it; removing one lets the runtime<br />unload it (subtree cleanup is reclaimed out-of-band). The InferenceService<br />is never modified for adapter changes — it mounts the whole per-service<br />subtree read-only. Entries are pure references; (kind, name) pairs must be<br />unique.

Set to 0 to enable scale-to-zero: KEDA idles the predictor<br />to zero replicas when idle and brings it back up on the next request.<br />When specified with MaxReplicas, enables autoscaling for the service. |  | Minimum: 0 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `maxReplicas` _integer_ | MaxReplicas specifies the maximum number of replicas for autoscaling.<br />Required when MinReplicas is set or when AutoScaling configuration is provided. |  | Minimum: 1 <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |

| `adapterDiskPersistentVolumeClaim` _string_ | AdapterDiskPersistentVolumeClaim is the resolved shared adapter-disk PVC<br />(from the base model artifact's status). It is recorded here once resolved<br />and reused when a transient parent-resolution gap would otherwise leave it<br />empty, so a blip never re-renders the InferenceService without its adapter<br />mount and restarts a running predictor.

Used by the AIMModel controller to resolve<br />the deployment image for fine-tuned models whose spec.image is omitted<br />(versionPolicy=latest or any). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### ManagedProfileCounts



ManagedProfileCounts summarizes managed derivative profiles. The count
fields intentionally omit `omitempty` so that a zero count serializes as
an explicit `0` rather than dropping the field. This keeps the status
shape stable for both kubectl printcolumns and chainsaw assertions —
callers can rely on `.status.managedProfiles.{total,ready,...}` always
being present once the controller has observed the resource.

| `notAvailable` _integer_ | NotAvailable is the number of derivative profiles whose own status is NotAvailable. |  |  |
| `deployable` _integer_ | Deployable is the number of managed profiles whose spec is materialised<br />enough to back an AIMService (carries aimId and modelSources). For a<br />normal officially-discovered AIMModel this equals Total. For a<br />base-image AIMModel used as a source for custom-model derivation<br />this is 0 — the model only emits base profiles that callers must<br />derive into deployable profiles. |  |  |
| `base` _integer_ | Base is the number of managed profiles whose spec is structurally<br />incomplete (missing aimId or modelSources). Base profiles cannot back<br />an AIMService directly and exist purely as source material for<br />derivation via AIMModel.spec.profiles.derivedFrom with<br />selector.role=base. A non-zero value is the canonical operational<br />signal that this model is a base-image model (the source of<br />custom-model derivation). |  |  |

#### ProfileHardwareGroup



ProfileHardwareGroup is one accelerator footprint within a model's
discovery catalog, with the metric/precision combos shipped under it.



_Appears in:_
- [DiscoveredProfileCounts](#discoveredprofilecounts)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `acceleratorType` _[AcceleratorType](#acceleratortype)_ | AcceleratorType is the resource family (gpu, cpu). |  | Enum: [gpu cpu] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorModel` _string_ | AcceleratorModel is the accelerator identifier (e.g., "MI300X",<br />"EPYC_ZEN5"). Empty for profiles with no accelerator requirement. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorCount` _integer_ | AcceleratorCount is the number of accelerator units the profile<br />requests. For gpu: device count (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8 for tensor-parallel<br />sizes). For cpu: number of CPU cores (e.g., 128 for EPYC_ZEN5,<br />192 for EPYC_9965). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `supported` _boolean_ | Supported reports whether this hardware footprint is currently<br />satisfied by at least one cluster node. When false, all profiles in<br />this group are skipped during materialisation. |  |  |
| `profiles` _[ProfileHardwareGroupEntry](#profilehardwaregroupentry) array_ | Profiles lists the \{metric, precision\} combinations discovered under<br />this hardware footprint. Reported even when the group is unsupported<br />so users can see what they're missing. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### ProfileHardwareGroupEntry



ProfileHardwareGroupEntry identifies one profile within a hardware group
by its {metric, precision} pair. Sufficient for users to spot whether the
optimization variant they want is shipped at all.



_Appears in:_
- [ProfileHardwareGroup](#profilehardwaregroup)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metric` _[AIMMetric](#aimmetric)_ | Metric is the optimization target (latency, throughput). |  | Enum: [latency throughput] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |

#### ProfileOrigin

_Underlying type:_ _string_

ProfileOrigin classifies how an AIMProfile / AIMClusterProfile was produced.
Stamped by AIMProfile reconcilers via the `aim.eai.amd.com/profile-origin`
label and the AIMProfile `status.origin` field. Iteration-1 producers
stamp `discovered` (image discovery) and `derived` (AIMProfileSet /
AIMModel.spec.profiles.derivedFrom); user-authored profiles are backfilled
to `user-authored` by the AIMProfile reconciler when no AIM controller
owns them.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [discovered derived user-authored]

_Appears in:_
- [ProfileSelector](#profileselector)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `discovered` | ProfileOriginDiscovered indicates the profile was produced by image<br />discovery (today: AIMModel.spec.image native discovery path).<br /> |
| `derived` | ProfileOriginDerived indicates the profile was produced by a derivation<br />flow (AIMModel.spec.profiles.derivedFrom or an AIMProfileSet).<br /> |
| `user-authored` | ProfileOriginUserAuthored indicates the profile was created<br />independently by a user (no AIM controller owner reference).<br /> |


#### ProfileOverrides



ProfileOverrides mutates selected source profiles when creating derived copies.

Identity fields (`aimId`, `modelId`, `profileId`) and behavioural fields
(`image`, `acceleratorModel`, `acceleratorCount`, env, args, modelSources)
always WRITE onto the derived profile. They are the "stamp on the output"
half of the derivation contract — the `selector` half FILTERS source
candidates and never mutates anything. Keeping these halves separated is
what lets a single YAML mean exactly one thing.

For `selector.role=base` derivations, `overrides.aimId` and
`overrides.modelId` are REQUIRED (enforced by CEL on the enclosing spec):
base profiles ship with empty identity fields by design, so the derived
profile would otherwise have no identity to bind against.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMModelProfilesSpec](#aimmodelprofilesspec)
- [AIMProfileSetSpec](#aimprofilesetspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aimId` _string_ | AimId stamps the derived profile's spec.aimId. When set, wins over<br />the source profile's aimId. REQUIRED when the enclosing selector has<br />role=base (the source base profile carries no aimId of its own). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `modelId` _string_ | ModelId stamps the derived profile's spec.modelId. When set, wins<br />over both the source profile's modelId AND the auto-derivation from<br />modelSources[0].modelId. REQUIRED when the enclosing selector has<br />role=base. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `profileId` _string_ | ProfileId stamps the derived profile's spec.profileId. Optional —<br />most callers leave this empty and let the source profile's profileId<br />carry through (or the reconciler synthesise one). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `modelSources` _[AIMModelSource](#aimmodelsource) array_ | ModelSources replaces the copied profile's modelSources. When<br />modelSources[0].modelId is set and overrides.modelId is unset, the<br />derived profile's modelId is auto-derived from modelSources[0]; an<br />explicit overrides.modelId always wins. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `image` _string_ | Image overrides the runtime container image used by the derived<br />profiles. When empty the deployment image is rebased onto the source<br />profile's base-image (status.baseImage) so private mirrors stay<br />self-contained. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorModel` _string_ | AcceleratorModel replaces the copied profile's acceleratorModel. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorCount` _integer_ | AcceleratorCount replaces the copied profile's acceleratorCount. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorPartitioningMode` _string_ | AcceleratorPartitioningMode replaces the copied profile's<br />acceleratorPartitioningMode. Complete replacement, not a merge; an empty<br />override string leaves the source profile's mode untouched. Same reserved<br />values as AIMProfileSpecCommon.AcceleratorPartitioningMode. Whenever this<br />override is set (to any value, including "unpartitioned"), the CEL rule on the<br />enclosing spec also requires AcceleratorCount to be set: partition mode<br />changes the per-unit interpretation of acceleratorCount, and CEL cannot<br />read the base profile to tell whether the meaning actually changed, so it<br />conservatively requires the count be restated. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `containerEnv` _[EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#envvar-v1-core) array_ | ContainerEnv merges by env var name, overriding matching source entries. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `engineEnv` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | EngineEnv merges by key, overriding matching source entries. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `engineArgs` _[JSON](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#json-v1-apiextensions-k8s-io)_ | EngineArgs shallow-merges on top of the source engineArgs, overriding matching keys. |  | Type: object <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### ProfileSelector



ProfileSelector narrows the source profiles selected for derivation.



_Appears in:_
- [AIMModelProfilesDerivedFrom](#aimmodelprofilesderivedfrom)
- [AIMProfileSetSpec](#aimprofilesetspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |

| `type` _[AIMProfileType](#aimprofiletype)_ | Type filters by optimization level (exact match). |  | Enum: [optimized general preview unoptimized] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `minimumType` _[AIMProfileTypeFloor](#aimprofiletypefloor)_ | MinimumType filters by a minimum optimization level: candidates whose<br />type is this tier OR BETTER are accepted (hierarchy: optimized > general<br />> preview > unoptimized). This is the floor counterpart to the exact-match<br />Type field; the two AND together when both are set.<br />The sentinel "any" disables the floor (accept every tier). When this<br />field is empty the AIMService resolver applies a default floor of<br />"optimized" so auto-selection prefers production-grade profiles and never<br />silently picks an unoptimized one; to opt a service into lower tiers<br />(e.g. CPU/EPYC profiles published as unoptimized) set minimumType<br />explicitly to "unoptimized" or "any". Derivation selectors<br />(AIMProfileSet / AIMModel.profiles) treat empty as "any" so copying is<br />never tier-restricted by default. |  | Enum: [optimized general preview unoptimized any] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorModel` _string_ | AcceleratorModel filters by accelerator identifier. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorPartitioningMode` _string_ | AcceleratorPartitioningMode filters candidates by their declared<br />partitioning mode. Partial-order match (NOT strict equality):<br />  ""              - no filter on this field.<br />  "unpartitioned" - matches profiles with mode "" or "unpartitioned".<br />  "partitioned"   - matches profiles whose mode is non-trivial (anything<br />                    other than "" / "unpartitioned").<br />  "<C>"           - selector-only convenience: matches profiles with mode<br />                    "<C>-*" (prefix on the scheme). Not a valid profile-spec<br />                    value (e.g. selector "CPX" matches "CPX-NPS1", "CPX-NPS4").<br />  "<C>-<M>"       - exact-string match on the scheme. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorType` _[AcceleratorType](#acceleratortype)_ | AcceleratorType filters by accelerator resource type. |  | Enum: [gpu cpu] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `acceleratorCount` _integer_ | AcceleratorCount filters by accelerator unit count. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `engineArgs` _[JSON](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/#json-v1-apiextensions-k8s-io)_ | EngineArgs partially matches source engineArgs: every provided top-level key must<br />exist in the source object with an equal value. |  | Type: object <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `modelRef` _[ProfileSelectorModelRef](#profileselectormodelref)_ | ModelRef narrows candidates to those produced by a specific<br />AIM(Cluster)Model, matched via the `aim.eai.amd.com/source-model[-scope]`<br />labels stamped by the AIMModel reconcilers. Iteration 1 (v1alpha2 only). |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `role` _[ProfileSelectorRole](#profileselectorrole)_ | Role filters by the `aim.eai.amd.com/profile-role` label. Defaults to<br />`deployable`. `base` filters to base profiles emitted by base-image<br />discovery (custom-model derivation source material). | deployable | Enum: [base deployable] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `origin` _[ProfileOrigin](#profileorigin)_ | Origin filters by the `aim.eai.amd.com/profile-origin` label. When unset<br />(empty) the selector does not filter by origin. Iteration 1 (v1alpha2<br />only). |  | Enum: [discovered derived user-authored] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### ProfileSelectorModelRef



ProfileSelectorModelRef narrows derivation candidates by their owning
AIMModel / AIMClusterModel. The v1alpha2 AIMProfileSet reconciler matches
candidates by the `aim.eai.amd.com/source-model[-scope]` labels stamped by
AIMModel reconcilers.



_Appears in:_

#### ProfileSelectorRole

_Underlying type:_ _string_

ProfileSelectorRole filters source profiles by their role label
(`aim.eai.amd.com/profile-role`). Discovery of a deployable AIM image
stamps the `deployable` role; base-image discovery stamps `base` on
profiles that carry no aimId/modelSources, which custom-model AIMModels
derive into deployable copies.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [base deployable]

_Appears in:_
- [ProfileSelector](#profileselector)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `base` | ProfileSelectorRoleBase filters down to base profiles that are not yet<br />deployable (no aimId / modelSources, only image + base-image so they can<br />serve as derivation source material for custom-model AIMModels).<br /> |
| `deployable` | ProfileSelectorRoleDeployable filters down to fully deployable profiles<br />(with aimId and modelSources). This is the default.<br /> |


#### ProfileSelectorScope

_Underlying type:_ _string_

ProfileSelectorScope determines how a ProfileSelector.ModelRef resolves the
source AIMModel scope. The v1alpha2 AIMProfileSet reconciler honours this
value when filtering source profiles by `aim.eai.amd.com/source-model[-scope]`
labels.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [Auto Namespace Cluster]

_Appears in:_
- [ProfileSelectorModelRef](#profileselectormodelref)

| Field | Description |

# Accelerator Detection

The AcceleratorDetector automatically detects hardware accelerators on cluster nodes and publishes the results as Kubernetes node labels via [Node Feature Discovery (NFD)](https://nfd.sigs.k8s.io/). AIM Engine uses these labels to schedule inference workloads onto appropriate hardware. The AcceleratorDetector is enabled by default.

The labels feed two different consumers depending on API version:

- **v1alpha2** — `AIMProfile.spec.acceleratorModel` is matched against the `feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.<model>` labels using the `Exists` operator. The match drives both profile `HardwareAvailable` reporting and inference-pod node affinity.
- **v1alpha1** — `AIMServiceTemplate.spec.hardware.gpu.model` feeds the same label system. Existing templates continue to work.

## How It Works

DaemonSets detect hardware on each node, write the results to NFD's local feature file directory, and NFD publishes them as node labels. The AMD GPU detector runs `aim-runtime detect-hardware` for the accelerator model and, independently, `amd-smi partition` for the GPU partition state; the NVIDIA GPU detector runs `nvidia-smi`; the CPU detector reads `/proc/cpuinfo`. Each detector also stamps a per-accelerator-type **vendor** label (see [Vendor Labels](#vendor-labels)).

```
Node boots
  → AcceleratorDetector pod starts
  → GPU: runs `aim-runtime detect-hardware` (model) + `amd-smi partition` (partition state)
    CPU: reads /proc/cpuinfo
  → Writes feature file(s) to /etc/kubernetes/node-feature-discovery/features.d/
  → NFD publishes node labels:
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.MI300X=8
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.partitioning-scheme.CPX-NPS4=64
  → AIM Engine matches profiles (or v1alpha1 templates) to nodes via label affinity
```

Detection runs periodically (Helm default `detectInterval: 10` seconds) to keep labels — including GPU partition state — current. The end-to-end latency floor is NFD's own scan interval, not `detectInterval`. (The bare `kustomize` manifests under `config/accelerator-detector/` ship a more conservative `300`s default; the Helm chart is the supported install path.)

## Node Labels

Each detected accelerator model produces a label under `feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.`. The key encodes the model identifier; the value is the accelerator count.

**GPU node:**

```
feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.MI300X: "8"
```

**CPU-only node:**

```
feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.EPYC_9965: "128"
```

| Hardware | Example Label |
|----------|---------------|
| AMD Instinct MI300X (8 GPUs) | `aim-accelerator.MI300X=8` |
| AMD Instinct MI325X (8 GPUs) | `aim-accelerator.MI325X=8` |
| NVIDIA H100 (8 GPUs) | `aim-accelerator.H100=8` |
| NVIDIA A100 (8 GPUs) | `aim-accelerator.A100=8` |
| AMD EPYC 9965 (192 cores) | `aim-accelerator.EPYC_9965=192` |
| AMD EPYC 9575F (64 cores) | `aim-accelerator.EPYC_9575F=64` |

NVIDIA product names reported by `nvidia-smi` (e.g. `NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3`, `NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB`) are normalized to a canonical token (`H100`, `A100`) for the label key. Consumer and workstation RTX cards are normalized by pattern too — `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090` → `RTX4090`, `NVIDIA RTX A6000` → `RTXA6000`, `NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation` → `RTX6000Ada` — so evaluating on a workstation GPU produces clean labels. Unrecognized names fall back to a sanitized slug and are logged so the token table can be extended.

:::{admonition} Consumer GPUs are for evaluation
:class: note

Consumer/workstation NVIDIA cards are detected and labelled (model, `GPU` family, and `vendor.GPU.NVIDIA`) so you can try AIM Engine on them, but detection does not imply every profile will run: consumer cards differ from datacenter parts in VRAM, interconnect (no NVLink), and features (e.g. no FP8 on Ampere consumer). Whether a given model serves is governed by the profile's own requirements, not the detector. Consumer cards have no MIG, so they report `partitioning-scheme.default`.
:::

AIM Engine constructs node affinity from `AIMProfile.spec.acceleratorModel` (or v1alpha1 `AIMServiceTemplate.spec.hardware.gpu.model`) using the `Exists` operator, without requiring any knowledge of hardware specifics. The label value (accelerator count) is informational only; actual capacity is enforced via the computed device resource request — see [Profiles — Accelerator and node affinity](profiles.md#accelerator-and-node-affinity).

:::{note}
Architecture-level labels for fallback profile matching (e.g. `aim-accelerator.CDNA3`, `aim-accelerator.EPYC_ZEN5`) will be supported once `aim-runtime` returns the full identifier hierarchy.
:::

## Vendor Labels

Each detector also publishes a **vendor** label, keyed per accelerator type, on the `feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.vendor.<TYPE>.<VENDOR>` axis. The vendor comes from the DaemonSet itself (each detector is vendor-specific), not from detection output.

Scoping the vendor by accelerator type lets a cross-vendor node carry one vendor key per type without conflict — for example, an NVIDIA GPU on an AMD EPYC host:

```
feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.vendor.GPU.NVIDIA: "8"
feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.vendor.CPU.AMD: "1"
```

| Node | Vendor labels |
|------|---------------|
| AMD MI300X ×8 | `aim-accelerator.vendor.GPU.AMD=8` |
| NVIDIA H100 ×8 | `aim-accelerator.vendor.GPU.NVIDIA=8` |
| AMD EPYC CPU-only | `aim-accelerator.vendor.CPU.AMD=192` |

Like the other labels, the value is the accelerator count and is informational; consumers match on the key via `Exists`. This iteration assumes a single vendor — and a single model — per accelerator type on a given node.

:::{note}
`AIMProfile.spec.acceleratorVendor` consumes this label when resolving nodes
and the device-plugin resource. `amd` selects `amd.com/gpu`; `nvidia` selects
`nvidia.com/gpu`. A generic NVIDIA profile can omit `acceleratorModel` and
match any detected NVIDIA GPU node.
:::

## GPU Partition Scheme Labels

On GPU nodes the detector also reads the current partition state from `amd-smi partition --current --json` and publishes it on a single partition axis, `feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.partitioning-scheme.*`. The kernel-applied state reported by `amd-smi` is the single source of truth — AMD GPU Operator / DCM labels are **not** consulted, because they can lag or disagree with the kernel.

Two kinds of value appear on this axis:

- A hardware-agnostic **`default`** sentinel meaning "canonical unpartitioned state, or hardware that doesn't expose partitioning at all".
- Explicit **`<Compute>-<Memory>`** scheme names (e.g. `CPX-NPS4`) for actively partitioned states, and `SPX-NPS1` for the canonical unpartitioned state on partitionable hardware.

| Node state | Labels |
|------------|--------|
| 8-GPU MI300X, unpartitioned (`SPX+NPS1`) | `aim-accelerator.MI300X=8`, `partitioning-scheme.default=8`, `partitioning-scheme.SPX-NPS1=8` |
| 8-GPU MI300X, `CPX+NPS4` (64 partitions) | `aim-accelerator.MI300X=8`, `partitioning-scheme.CPX-NPS4=64` |
| Non-partitionable hardware (e.g. Radeon) | `aim-accelerator.RadeonW7900=4`, `partitioning-scheme.default=4` |

The label *value* is the number of schedulable units in that bucket and is informational only. `AIMProfile.spec.acceleratorPartitioningMode` matches on the label *key* via `Exists` / `DoesNotExist`; see [Profiles — Accelerator and node affinity](profiles.md#accelerator-and-node-affinity).

Partition detection runs **independently of `detect-hardware`**: the scheme comes straight from `amd-smi partition --current --json`, so partition labels are published even on accelerator images that don't ship the `detect-hardware` command — and, conversely, a partition failure never suppresses the model/family labels (the two axes live in separate feature files; see [NFD Integration](#nfd-integration)). It is best-effort: when `amd-smi` is missing/old, times out, or returns unparseable output, the detector falls back to `partitioning-scheme.default` if it otherwise knows GPUs are present, and otherwise preserves the last-good partition labels rather than dropping them. The GPU detector image must ship an `amd-smi` that supports `partition --current --json`.

:::{note}
This iteration assumes the AMD GPU Operator's `resource_naming_strategy: single` (every GPU/partition advertised as `amd.com/gpu`). The partition labels themselves are strategy-independent (the detector reads `amd-smi`, not the device plugin), but partition-aware scheduling is only supported under `single` today.

## DaemonSets

| DaemonSet | Image | Target Nodes | Detects |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| GPU (AMD) | `aim-base` (includes ROCm) | Nodes with `feature.node.kubernetes.io/amd-gpu=true` | AMD Instinct GPUs via `amdsmi` |
| NVIDIA | `python:3-slim` (thin) | Nodes with `feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-10de.present=true` | NVIDIA GPUs via `nvidia-smi` |
| CPU | `aim-epyc-base` (no ROCm) | Nodes without the `amd-gpu` label | AMD EPYC CPUs via `/proc/cpuinfo` |

The AMD GPU DaemonSet uses a `nodeSelector` on the `amd-gpu` label (set by the AMD GPU Operator); the NVIDIA DaemonSet uses a `nodeSelector` on `pci-10de.present` (10de is NVIDIA's PCI vendor ID, set by the NVIDIA GPU Operator's NFD config). The CPU DaemonSet targets the remaining nodes.

:::{admonition} CPU detector and NVIDIA GPU nodes
:class: note

The CPU detector (`aim-epyc-base`) runs on nodes without the `amd-gpu` label, which includes NVIDIA GPU nodes. That is fine — and useful — on an AMD-EPYC host with NVIDIA GPUs (it labels the host CPU). On a **non-AMD host** (e.g. Intel) with NVIDIA GPUs, the EPYC-oriented CPU detection won't produce meaningful CPU labels; this is a known limitation. It does not affect the NVIDIA GPU labels, which come from the separate NVIDIA DaemonSet.
:::

The NVIDIA detector does **not** bake in any CUDA/driver: `nvidia-smi` and `libnvidia-ml` are injected from the host driver by the nvidia-container-toolkit. The pod therefore runs under the `nvidia` RuntimeClass with `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` and `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=utility`, and it does not request a `nvidia.com/gpu` resource (so it lands on every GPU node without consuming a GPU slot). On clusters whose NFD emits class+vendor PCI keys (e.g. `pci-0302_10de.present`) rather than the operator's vendor-only key, override the `nodeSelector` via Helm.

All DaemonSets are independently configurable via Helm values.

:::{note}
NVIDIA MIG geometry is not yet detected. NVIDIA GPU nodes currently report only the `partitioning-scheme.default` sentinel, so they match unpartitioned profiles. Per-instance MIG partition labels are a planned follow-up.
:::

### NFD Integration

Feature files are written to `/etc/kubernetes/node-feature-discovery/features.d/`. The CPU detector writes `aim-accelerator-cpu`; the GPU detector writes **two** files — `aim-accelerator-gpu` for the model/family labels (from `detect-hardware`) and `aim-accelerator-gpu-partition` for the partition axis (from `amd-smi`). NFD's [local source](https://nfd.sigs.k8s.io/usage/customization-guide#local-feature-source) picks up every file and merges the resulting labels onto the node. Splitting the model and partition axes into separate files lets the CPU and GPU detectors co-exist on heterogeneous nodes without clobbering each other, and gives each axis an independent lifecycle so a failure of one never overwrites the other's labels. Writes use an atomic rename to avoid race conditions with the NFD worker.

Labels are **sticky across transient failures**: a detection failure (the underlying tool is missing, exits non-zero, times out, or returns unparseable output) is treated as distinct from a confident "no accelerators here". On failure the detector leaves the relevant last-good feature file untouched and retries on the next cycle, rather than truncating it to empty. Because the model and partition axes are separate files, this applies to each independently — a transient `amd-smi` failure can't drop the model labels, and an absent `detect-hardware` can't drop the partition labels. It prevents a single transient hiccup from flapping a node's `aim-accelerator.*` labels and every consumer's profile/model availability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node Feature Discovery (NFD)** must be installed on the cluster. NFD is included with the AMD GPU Operator and the NVIDIA GPU Operator.
- **Container images** must be accessible. The AMD GPU DaemonSet uses `aim-base`; the CPU DaemonSet uses `aim-epyc-base`; the NVIDIA DaemonSet uses a thin `python:3-slim` image.
- **For NVIDIA detection:** the nvidia-container-toolkit must be installed (it injects `nvidia-smi`), and a `nvidia` RuntimeClass should exist (created by the NVIDIA GPU Operator). Both are present on any cluster already running NVIDIA GPU workloads.

## Configuration

The AcceleratorDetector is enabled by default. Configure it in your Helm `values.yaml`:

```yaml
acceleratorDetector:
  enable: true
  detectInterval: 10

  gpu:
    enable: true
    image:
      repository: "your-registry/aim-base"
      tag: "latest"
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: your-pull-secret

  cpu:
    enable: true
    image:
      repository: "your-registry/aim-epyc-base"
      tag: "latest"
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: your-pull-secret

  nvidia:
    enable: true
    image:
      repository: "your-registry/python"
      tag: "3-slim"
    # RuntimeClass that routes the pod through the nvidia-container-toolkit so
    # nvidia-smi is injected. Set to "" to use the node's default runtime.
    runtimeClassName: nvidia
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: your-pull-secret
```

The NVIDIA detector is enabled by default but only schedules on NVIDIA GPU nodes, so it is a no-op on AMD-only or GPU-free clusters.

To disable entirely:

```yaml
acceleratorDetector:
  enable: false
```

To disable CPU detection on a GPU-only cluster:

```yaml
acceleratorDetector:
  cpu:
    enable: false
```

## Relationship to k8s-device-plugin

The AMD [k8s-device-plugin Node Labeller](https://github.com/ROCm/k8s-device-plugin) writes GPU labels under `amd.com/gpu.*` (e.g. `amd.com/gpu.device-id=74a1`). The AcceleratorDetector writes a separate set of labels under `feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator.*`.

AIM Engine uses AcceleratorDetector model and vendor labels for profile
matching. AMD model matching retains fallback support for
`amd.com/gpu.device-id`; NVIDIA profiles use the detector's NVIDIA vendor/model
labels together with capacity advertised as `nvidia.com/gpu`. See
[GPU Management](../admin/gpu-management.md) for details.

## Verifying Labels

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq -r '
  .items[] |
  .metadata.name as $name |
  [.metadata.labels | to_entries[] | select(.key | startswith("feature.node.kubernetes.io/aim-accelerator."))] |
  if length > 0 then "\($name): \(map("\(.key | split(".") | last)=\(.value)") | join(", "))" else empty end'
```

Or:

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep aim-accelerator
```
